## Personal Portfolio Webpage!

Hey Guys! it's a Personal Portfolio Webpage!

### What i've used to make it

Mainy i've used HTML & CSS, also i have used little bit Bootstrap for navigation bar.

i have used `::before` pseudo Element for inserting a Background Image below my name. I have used Flexbox to make it Responsive. and at last i have made a footer, i have added 2 redirect links with `<a>` tag for my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/technical-shoubhik/) and [Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/technical_shoubhik/)
